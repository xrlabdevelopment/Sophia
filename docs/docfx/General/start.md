## Unity versions

Sophia v1.x.x is developed on top of Unity version 2019.3.0. Nevertheless, it is very likely that older versions of Unity are compatible as well.

For each major breaking change introduced, this because of a newer minimum Unity version, the major portion of the version number is automatically bumped. Use git tags to navigate to the latest compatible version for you own project.
